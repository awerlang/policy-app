### READ THIS BEFORE YOU BEGIN

This hiring project is intended to gauge a developer's ability to both work with the technologies we are using, as well as their soft-skills.

Technical prowess is a good thing but, by itself, is not enough to earn a spot on our team.

### Instructions

1. Fork this repo.
2. Review the guidelines
3. Follow the Project Requirements.
4. Reach out with any questions.
5. Submit a pull request when your project is finished.

### Project Requirements
#### Scenario
Welcome to Widgets Inc. We have an exciting new product in the insurance sector and we are hoping to expand our offering to cover more of our customer needs.

We've decided to create a simple SPA web-app that allows our customers to track their [property inspections](https://www.hippo.com/blog/underwriters-look-home-inspections) and report on the various results.


#### Success Conditions
1. Create an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web backend with an [Angular](https://angular.io/) frontend.
2. Store whatever information you think makes sense for a property inspection. Data points such as: bad wiring, wood burning fireplace present, roof condition, etc. would be a general idea of what might typically be used.
3. Create a utility function that generates random application data. Using this function should allow for the application to appear to have been in production use for some time.
4. Create several visual reports that dissect the available data and presents them in interesting and useful ways.


### Guidelines

1. Commit early, commit often. We would love to see more commits showing the process you took to get to the finished product. Please do not squash your commits.
2. Please use eslint. Airbnb is a great style to use for this project but you may choose another if you wish.
3. We'd prefer Typescript to JavaScript but it's not absolutely required.
4. Writing tests / using TDD practices would be a massive point in your favor.
5. Spend as much, or as little, time on this as you wish. That said, we'd prefer a project be delivered within a week.
6. We encourage you to reach out to us with any questions you may have. Doing so will not be seen as detrimental to your delivered project.
